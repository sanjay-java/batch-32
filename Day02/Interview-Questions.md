#### What is an object?
    An object is a real-world entity which is the basic unit of OOPs for example chair, cat, dog, etc. Different objects have different states or attributes, and behaviors.

#### What is a class?
    A class is a prototype that consists of objects in different states and with different behaviors. It has a number of methods that are common the objects present within that class.

#### What is Object Oriented Programming?
    Object-Oriented Programming(OOPs) is a type of programming that is based on objects rather than just functions and procedures. Individual objects are grouped into classes. OOPs implements real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, hiding, etc into programming. It also allows binding data and code together.

#### What is Inheritance
      Inheritance provides an object with the ability to acquire the fields and methods of another class, called base class. Inheritance provides re-usability of code and can be used to add additional features to an existing class, without modifying it.

#### Why Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance?
      Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance in classes because of “Diamond Problem”. More on diamond problem [here](https://salithachathuranga94.medium.com/inheritance-and-diamond-problem-in-java-9b525016efa3)

#### What is a superclass?
    A superclass or base class is a class that acts as a parent to some other class or classes. For example, the Vehicle class is a superclass of class Car.

#### What is a subclass?
    A class that inherits from another class is called the subclass. For example, the class Car is a subclass or a derived of Vehicle class.
